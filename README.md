As a Computer Science student and Linux enthusiast, I am deeply engaged in studying machine learning concepts and have been developing simple neural networks in Python.

I hold a FAPESP technical training project scholarship, where I contribute to the data management team.

Additionally, I am currently expanding my skills by learning Python for Data Science and Lua.
